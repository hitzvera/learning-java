java sources

1. online courses first (udemy)
2. books 

JRE (java runtime environment)
- a package that needed to run java application

JDK (java development kit)
- tools that needed to build/develop java application
JDK is also provide JRE.

JVM (java virtual machine)
jvm melakukan 3 fase write, compile and run

1. writing java application is done by we a programmer.
2. compile. is done by javac (java compiler) usually included in JDK. resulting 
bytecode.
3. in running phase, JMV execute the bytecode.

nb: what is differenciate between compile and interpreted.
pros compile language
1. private 
2. faster execution
3. fully optimized
cons compile language
1. no portability (when we make an executable, only 1 system operation)
2. extra compilation step (longger development time)

props interpret language
1. portable (because we provide source code not exe, as long as have interpreter)
2. easy debugging (interpret check line by line)
cons 
1. requires interpreter
2. slower (the translation happen every time)
3. public code (if others want to run your application, you need to provide the source code).

hybrid approach
1. private source code, because when it compiled the result is not directly executable.
but bytecode that can run in any local machine as long as they have interpreter (JRE, more specific JVM).
